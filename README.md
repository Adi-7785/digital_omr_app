## About

In competitive exams, OMR sheets are often used for recording responses of candidates. Once filled the response can't be edited. 
We as candidates not only need to be well aware of this fact and also practice in such formats so we don't end up losing marks just for silly mistakes.
This app imitates physical OMR sheet but even more so, you can go on checking your responses.
